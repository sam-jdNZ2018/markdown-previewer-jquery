# JQuery Markdown Previewer

Viewable at [this link](https://sam-jdnz2018.github.io/markdown-previewer-jquery/).

This project is a jQuery interpretation of the 'Build a Markdown Previewer' project from the 'Front-End Libraries' section of 
FreeCodeCamp's curriculum. This version was made as a way to learn how to code in jQuery and was built of a React version I made earlier.
